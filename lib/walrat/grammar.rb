      # basis.
      #
      # This allows for simpler grammars which do not need to explicitly put
      # optional whitespace parslets (or any other kind of parslet) between
      # elements.
      #
      # There are two modes of operation for this method. In the first mode
      # (when only one parameter is passed) the rule_or_parslet parameter is
      # used to define the default parslet for inter-token skipping.
      # rule_or_parslet must refer to a rule which itself is a Parslet or
      # ParsletCombination and which is responsible for skipping. Note that the
      # ability to pass an arbitrary parslet means that the notion of what
      # consitutes the "whitespace" that should be skipped is completely
      # flexible. Raises if a default skipping parslet has already been set.
      #
      # In the second mode of operation (when two parameters are passed) the
      # rule_or_parslet parameter is interpreted to be the rule to which an
      # override should be applied, where the parslet parameter specifies the
      # parslet to be used in this case. If nil is explicitly passed then this
      # overrides the default parslet; no parslet will be used for the purposes
      # of inter-token skipping. Raises if an override has already been set for
      # the named rule.
      #
      # The inter-token parslet is passed inside the "options" hash when
      # invoking the "parse" methods. Any parser which fails will retry after
      # giving this inter-token parslet a chance to consume and discard
      # intervening whitespace.
      #

      # skipping for ParsletSequence and ParsletRepetition combinations.
